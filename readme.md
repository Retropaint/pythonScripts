# Python Scripts

A collection of python scripts I've made on an afternoon for one purpose or another.

## Color Compressor

A simple color compressor I made by myself. Algorithm too, though it's not as good as ones you'll find on the Internet.

### Purpose

I was looking into reducing png file sizes by reducing colors, then editing the image on something like Photoshop to make it look as good as original (hence the saturation parameter). This didn't turn out as planned.

### To-Do

explain the algorithm here, or in another readme file

## ASCII Resizer

A resizer for text files. Uses basic algorithm of identifying the ratios of pixels, then using the top-left one if the target resolution is smaller than source.

### Purpose 

As of writing this, I'm in the process of prototyping a TTY game and needed to be able to resize sprites.
